        <h3>Web Development</h3>
        <p>Web development refers to the process of creating websites and web applications for the internet. It involves using programming languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the structure, style, and interactive elements of a website. Popular frameworks include React, Angular, and Vue.js.</p>

        <blockquote>
            “Website without visitors is like a ship lost in the horizon.” - Dr. Christopher Dayagdag
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Virtualization and Containerization</h3>
        <p>Virtualization involves creating a virtual version of a physical machine, allowing multiple operating systems to run on a single hardware resource. <a href="https://www.vmware.com">VMware</a> and <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org">VirtualBox</a> are popular virtualization tools.</p>
        <p>Containerization, on the other hand, focuses on packaging software and its dependencies into containers. Docker and Kubernetes are leading technologies in this field.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Docker - A platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers.</li>
            <li>Kubernetes - An open-source system for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Requirements Analysis for Software</h3>
        <p>Requirements analysis is a critical stage in software development, where the needs and expectations of users and stakeholders are gathered and documented. The process includes identifying functional and non-functional requirements and ensuring that they align with the project's objectives.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Identify stakeholders</li>
            <li>Gather requirements</li>
            <li>Document and validate requirements</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Mobile Device Programming Languages</h3>
        <p>There are several programming languages used for developing mobile applications:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Java</b> - Used for Android development.</li>
            <li><b>Swift</b> - The primary language for iOS development.</li>
            <li><b>Kotlin</b> - A modern language for Android development, fully interoperable with Java.</li>
            <li><b>React Native</b> - A JavaScript framework for building mobile apps using React.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Visual Programming Languages</h3>
        <p>Visual programming languages (VPLs) allow developers to create programs using graphical elements rather than text-based code. These languages are useful for beginners and for designing complex systems visually. Examples include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Scratch - A popular VPL for teaching programming concepts to children.</li>
            <li>LabVIEW - A VPL used for system design and control applications.</li>
            <li>Blockly - A library for creating visual block-based coding interfaces.</li>
        </ul>
